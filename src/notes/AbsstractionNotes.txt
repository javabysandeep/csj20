- concrete method: a method with method body/ implementation
- concrete class: a class which contains only concrete methods
- abstract method: a method created with abstract keyword without method body/implementation
- abstract class: a class which can contain abstract methods
- abstraction: it is a process of hiding the implementation details[method body] and exposing the functionality[method declaration]
- How do we achieve abstraction?
    - abstract class
    - interface: it is a fully unimplemented class which contains only abstract methods[ incomplete methods]


#Abstract class
- we create abstract class with abstract keyword.
- We can have all components of concrete class plus abstract methods inside the abstract class
- We can't create the object of abstract class since it is declared abstract[incomplete].
- when one concrete class extends another abstract class, then it is compulsory for the child class to provide the implementation.
- when one abstract class extends another abstract class, then it is optional for the child class to provide the implementation.

Q. How to call the abstract class constructor?
A. We create the concrete child class and extend abstract class
   then with child class object creation internally child class constructor calls the parent class abstract

# if we try to create an objetc of an abstract class or interface then we get compile time exception: InstantiationException
