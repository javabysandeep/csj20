Primitive variable: A variable which holds a primitive value.
    int a =30;
    // a is primitive variable
    // int is type of value
    // 30 is value

Reference variable: A variable which holds reference/address of an object.
    e.g. Product product = new Product();
        // product : reference variable which holds address of an object of type Product
        // new Product():  this is object of type of Product
        // Product: it is type which specifies the type of object

- class:
    - it is keyword which is used to create a class/ category/ group
    - it is derived from the word classification.
    - class is a blueprint/ template, structure, layout, plan, design, derived data type to create an object
    - Why do we need? to create objects
    - How to create class: class ClassName {}
    - With single class we can create any no. of objects.

    class contains
        - state/attributes/variables/properties/data/info/columns/fields/
        - behaviour/methods/functions/procedure/routine/implementation/

- Object:
    - it is an instance of class.
    - instance is an any memory space allocated.
    - Object is a memory space allocated for the class type data.
    - Why do need an object? to store data.
    - How to create an object?
        - syntax: ClassName referenceVariableName = new ClassName();
        - Product product = new Product(); // RHS is an object

#Variable:
    #. Based on the value:
        1. Primitive variable
        2. Reference variable

    #. based on the memory it occupies
        1. Local variable
            ---> Variables which are created inside the method,method parameter, constructor or blocks,
            --> Stack memory
            - Local variable will get the memory when the method, block, constructor is called.
            1. Local Primitive variable
            2. Local Reference variable
        2. Instance Variable [ object specific]
            --> Variables which are created at class level outside
                all methods, constructors,blocks
                without static keyword are called as instance variables.
            --> Heap Memory area
            1. Instance Primitive variable
            2. Instance Reference variable
            - instance variables are used to store object specific data.
            - instance variable will get the memory every time we create an object.
            How to access instance variables?
            Ans. We need a reference to access the heap memory area.
            e.g. Product p = new Product();
                    p.productId, p.productName

        3. Static variables
             -- class or method memory area
            --> Variables which are created at class level outside
                  all methods, constructors,blocks
                     with static keyword are called as static variables.
            1. static Primitive variable
            2. static Reference variable
        - static variables are used to store common data for all objects.
        - static is used share data across all objects.
        - static variable gets the memory only once at the time class loading.
        - How to access static variables?
            By using className.
            ClassName.staticVarName

class components
    - variables
        - reference
        - primitive
        - final
        - local
        - instance
        - static
    - methods/functions/procedure/routine/behaviour/implementation/task
        What is it?
            - It is a group of statements which are enclosed inside the {}.
            - It has a name also.
            - Method can accept input via method parameters
            - Method can return output also via return statement.
        Why to use?
            - to achieve code reusability
            - we can apply access specifiers so we can secure the code.
       How to use?
            syntax: accessSpecifier returnType methodName(method params){
                //statements
                // optional return
            }
            public static void main(String[] multipleStrings){
                //statements
            }
       - Types of methods
        - instance methods :
            - are object specific
            - How to access: by using reference since it belongs to object

            - e.g. float getBalance(){
                    return balance;
                }
                Account ac = new Account();
                ac.getBalance();

        - static methods :
            - common for all
            - by using className we access it.

            e.g. static void print(Object obj){
                    SOP(obj);
                    }

                    Account.print(null);


        - default methods
        - abstract methods
        - final methods

       - constructors
            - What is it?
                - It is a method which has same name as of class name without any return type or access modifiers[final, static, abstract]
                e.g. class Student{
                        public Student(){
                           // statements
                        }
                    }
            - Why do we need?
              - These are used to construct to the object.
              - Initialization:  providing some initial value for instance variables.
              - constructing the object means providing some initial value for the object state.[instance variables]
              - Use of Constructor: to provide some initial value for instance variables only not for local or static variable.
            - How to the use constructor?
                e.g. class Student{
                        int rollNumber;//0
                        String name; //null
                       public Student(){
                        rollNumber = 30;
                        name = "dummy";
                        System.out.println("constructor");
                       }
                    }
                 Student student = new Student();

    # Types of constructor:
        - default constructor:
                - As a developer, if we do not provide any constructor then java compiler provides the default constructor.
                - but if developer provides any constructor then default constructor will not be provided by the java compiler.
                - default constructor does not accept input. zero params, and it does not have any implementation/code inside the constructor body.
        - zero param: it is developed by developer which does not accept any parameter
        - parameterized: it is developed by developer which accepts the parameters.

    # Blocks ---->
    1. instance blocks
    What: it is a block of code enclosed in curly braces at class level without any modifiers
    Why: It is used to perform non-initialization activity such as maintaining the counter, logging, auditing
    How: {
            //block of code
        }
    When: Every time object is created the instance block will be called.

    2. static block
    What: it is a block of code enclosed in curly braces at class level with static keyword
    Why: It is used to perform onetime activity such as database connection, loading the drivers, loading server configuration
    How: static {
            //block of code
        }
    When: It will be called only once at the time of class loading.
    ------------------------------
    Order of execution:
        Static block
        Instance blocks
        constructors

# this keyword
    - what is it?
        - It is a keyword and which is reference variable which points to the current class object.
    - why do need it?
        - since it ie being a reference to the current class object, we can access the current class object, instance variable, instance method
        - When local variable and instance variable have the same, then to differentiate between them, we use this keyword.
        - With this keyword, we can call the same class constructor from another constructor of the same class.
            - we can't call more than one constructor from a given constructor.
            - call to the constructor must be the first line of code inside the constructor. otherwise, we get the CTE.
        - with the help of this, we can the current class object reference.
        - with the help of this, we can pass the current class object reference as a method parameter.

    - How to use it?
        this();
        this.iv;
        this.instanceMethod();
