What is an Array?
- Collection of multiple elements which are of same type and those elements are stored in continuous memory
- With array we can hold multiple values of same data type.

How to create an array?
 datatype arrayName[] = new datatype[sizeofArray];
 e.g. int array[] = new int[10]; // declaration+ initialization
 e.g. int arr[] = {10,20,30,40,50};

- Array is internally treated as an object.
e.g. int arr[] = new int[10];
[] denotes it is an array type variable.
- we do not specify anything inside left side []
- when we create an array an object is created.
- Inside that object array size variables will be created and will be initialized with default value

# How to access the array elements?
- we access the array element with index.
- index starts from 0 and till array length-1
e.g. int[] array = {1,3,4,6};
    SOP(array[0]);


Why array index starts from zero?
- array variable points to the base address where all elements are stored sequentially.
- first element : baseAddress + dataTypeSize * 0
- second element: BA + dataTypeSize * 1

int a,b= 10;

int[] a, b;// a and b are array type
int a, b[];// a is int and b is array type
int []a, b; // both a and b are array type
int []a, b=10; //  a is array and b is int
int a, b[], c,d; //   b is array, a,c and d are int type


# single dimension: single row


# multi dimension: multiple rows


e.g. name, Marks
