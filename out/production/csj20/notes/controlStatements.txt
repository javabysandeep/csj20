Topic: Control Statements
Date: Tuesday 25 Jan, 2022

What are control statements?
 - control statements helps to decide the flow of execution of the code.
 - helps in deciding which part of the code to execute, skip, and repeat.

Types control statements:
1. conditional statements :
    -They help you to decide which part of the code to execute and
        skip the code based on some condition(boolean) or some value
    - if else [condition]
    - switch [value]
2. looping statements/ repeat / iterative statements
  repeat the statements
    - for [ when no. of iterations are known in advance]
    - while [ when no. of iterations are not known in advance]
    - do_ while [ when no. of iterations are not known in advance & want to execute code at least once]
    - foreach [array and collections]
3. transfer statements
    To transfer the control of execution
    - return [ we can return the value, ]
    - break
    - continue

if:
- What is it?  it is control statement which is a keyword
- Why to use it?
    - For decision-making
    - to decide which part of the code to execute.
    - if the condition is true then if block is executed.
    - If the condition is false then rest of the code is executed.
- if can come independently.
syntax:
        if (condition) {
        // block of statements are executed if the condition is true
        }
       condition:
        - condition can be direct boolean value
        - it can be an expression which results into boolean value
        - it can be a method call which returns boolean value.


else :
- it is keyword and it comes with if.
- else cannot come independent. it should be always with if.
- else block is executed when the if condition is false.

syntax:
        if(condition){
          // if the cond is true
        }

        else {
            // if the cond is false
        }
- we cannot write independent statements in-between if and else otherwise it leads CTE
