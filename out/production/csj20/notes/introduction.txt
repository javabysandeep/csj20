Variable : It is a name give to a memory location address
Use of variable: To access the data stored or store the data at the memory location
How to use it? int number = 50; // In this number is variable

Datatype:
    1. It specifies type of data that is being stored in variable
    2. It specifies the memory requirement
    3. It specifies the range of allowed values

Different data types available in java
1. To store whole numbers
    byte --- 1 byte -- range -128 to 127
    short -- 2 bytes  range -32768 to 32767
    int -- 4 bytes range  -2147148
    long  -- 8 bytes
2. To store decimal or floating numbers
    float -- 4 bytes
    double  -- 8 bytes
3. To store character data
    char -- 2 bytes
4. To store boolean value
    boolean -- 1 byte , true, false

Typecasting: It is a process of assigning one data type value to another data type value.
Types of typecasting:
    1. Implicit typecasting:
        - Whenever we assign a smaller data type value to a bigger datatype value
        - e.g. byte b1 = 50;
             int a = b1;//implicit typecasting
        - This is done automatically by the compiler.
        - There will not be any data loss.
    2. Explicit typecasting:
        - whenever we assign a larger data type value to another smaller datatype value
        - e.g. int a = 130;
                byte b = (byte)a;
                SOP(b);//
        - This has to be done by developer.
        - There might be data loss.
